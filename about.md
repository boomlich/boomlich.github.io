Hi! My name is Thomas. I live in Bergen, currently attending the second year of my bachelor's degree in computer technology at the University of Bergen.

## Current goal
My current computer science goal is to learn `OpenGL` and graphics programming with `c++`. Ultimately, I want to create my own rendering engine and/or game engine.

## How I discovered my passion for programming

It all started when I experimented with creating games in `Unreal Engine 4` (UE). At that time, I had little to no programming experience, but the great thing about UE is that it has a visual scripting tool called `Blueprints`. With Blueprints, I created game logic and gameplay systems without a single line of code. Seeing these systems respond to the player's inputs was very intriguing. Thus the spark was lit.


### Things i use or have experience with:
- Tools: Intellij, Visual Studio, VScode, Adobe CC, Unreal Engine
- Languages: C++, Java, javascript, python, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- Frameworks/Libraries: Jekyll
