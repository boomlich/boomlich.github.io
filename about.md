Hi! My name is Thomas. I live in Bergen, currently attending the second year of my bachelor's degree in computer technology at the University of Bergen.

My current computer science goal is to learn `OpenGL` and graphics programming with `c++`. Graphics and 3D have always fascinated me. I originally wanted to be a 3D artist when I was younger. 

Hover, as I started experimenting with creating games in `Unreal Engine 4` (UE), I discovered my interest in programming. At that time, I had little to no programming experience, but the great thing about UE is that it has a visual scripting tool called `Blueprints`. With Blueprints, I created game logic and gameplay systems without a single line of code. Seeing these systems respond to the player's inputs was very fun.



### Things i use or have experience with:
- Tools: Intellij, Visual Studio, VScode, Adobe CC, Unreal Engine
- Languages: C++, Java, javascript, python, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- Frameworks/Libraries: Jekyll
