Orcattc was my submission for a compulsory assignment in INF101 - Object Orientet Programming. For the assignement we were free to choose
the project. As someone who played a lot of Bloon Tower Defence in my youth, I thought it would be an interesting challange to create a similar
game. 

The project was awarded best project among all the submissions.

 Requirements:

### UI system

I was tempted to utalize the swing JComponent system for creating the UI, but found that it was challangeing to achive my vision for the UI. Therefore, I desided to create a custom UI system, that is inspired by HTML's div system.

The system main components is containers, which can have child and parent containers, have padding, alignments, and different layouts. Even though the system is quite limited, it still allows for great customization.

### Pixel art 

All the art for the game was customly created in Aseprite.
