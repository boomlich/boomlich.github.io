This was one of the early projects I created in Java. I was fascinated by how racing games implement autonomous characters that the player can compete for agains. I stumbled upon a [old paper](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/) from 1997, by Craig Renolds, that described how such a system works. And so the project was born.
