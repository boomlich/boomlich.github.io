This was a school mandatory assignement about socket programming. The assignement was to turn a extended version of Rock, Paper, Sisscor game
that was originally a local, non-socket program, into a networking application using a server-client model. 

The project was a collaboration between me and two other classmates, Nikita and Ivar.
