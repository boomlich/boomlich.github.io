Tetris was created as part of the first mandatory assignment in my course INF101 - Object Oriented Programming at UiB.

### Game Modes

The primary mode of the game is single-player, where you compete against yourself to get the highest possible score.

The game features a local multiplayer mode, where two players can compete on one keyboard. In this game mode, the player that survives the longest wins. By clearing a regular row of blocks, the row will be added to the opponent's board, bringing him closer to defeat.

Unfortunatly, the source code for this project is not available publicly on GitHub, due to a request from our professor.
