### Game Modes

The game features a singleplayer mode where you compete aginst yourself to get the highest possible score.

The game also features a local multiplayer mode, where two players can compete on one keyboard. In this game mode, the player that survives the longest wins. By clearing a regular row of blocks, that row will be sent to the other player, pushing his blocks up, closer to defeat.
